\chapter{Research Methodology}
This chapter lists and discusses the specific steps and activities that will be performed by the proponent to accomplish the project. 
The discussion covers the activities from pre-proposal to Final Thesis Writing.  It also includes an initial discussion on the theoretical
framework to be followed.

\section{Research Activities}
Research activities include inquiry, survey, research, brainstorming, canvassing, consultation, review, interview, observe, experiment, design, 
test, document, etc.  The methodology also includes the following information:

\begin{itemize}
   \item who is responsible for the task
   \item the resource person to be contacted
   \item what will be done
   \item when and how long will the activity be done
   \item where will it be done
   \item why should be activity be done
\end{itemize}


\section{Calendar of Activities}

A Gantt chart showing the schedule of the activities should be included as a table. For example:

Table \ref{tab:timetableactivities} shows a Gantt chart of the activities.  Each bullet represents approximately
one week worth of activity.

%
%  the following commands will be used for filling up the bullets in the Gantt chart
%
\newcommand{\weekone}{\textbullet}
\newcommand{\weektwo}{\textbullet \textbullet}
\newcommand{\weekthree}{\textbullet \textbullet \textbullet}
\newcommand{\weekfour}{\textbullet \textbullet \textbullet \textbullet}

%
%  alternative to bullet is a star
