\chapter{Review of Related Literature}
\label{sec:relatedlit}

This chapter discusses the features, capabilities, and limitations of existing research, algorithms, or software 
that are related/similar to the thesis.

 The reviewed works and software must be arranged either in chronological order, or by area (from general to specific).  
Observe a consistent format when presenting each of the reviewed works. This must be selected in consultation with the prospective adviser.

\textcolor{red}{DO NOT FORGET to cite your references.}

Guide on Writing your RRL chapter
 
1. Identify the keywords with respect to your research
      One keyword = One document section
                Examples: 2.1 Story Generation Systems
			 2.2 Knowledge Representation

2.  Find references using these keywords

3.  For each of the references that you find,
        Check: Is it relevant to your research?
        Use their references to find more relevant works.

4. Identify a set of criteria for comparison.
       It will serve as a guide to help you focus on what to look for

5. Write a summary focusing on -
       What: A short description of the work
       How: A summary of the approach it utilized
       Findings: If applicable, provide the results
        Why: Relevance to your work

6. At the end of each section,  show a Table of Comparison of the related works 
   and your proposed project/system
